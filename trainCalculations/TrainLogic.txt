moment is always current time so anything we use it's referencing that. We're figuring out the difference between when the first train ran and our current time ex: if the first train was 5am and it's now 6am it's been an hour. Then we divide that difference by the frequency. If the train comes every 7 minutes then 60 min/7min is 8 with 4 minutes left over. So we're only 4 minutes into the 7 minute wait. 7-4 = we have 3 minutes left to wait
